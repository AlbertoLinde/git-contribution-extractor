# Git Contribution Extractor

![img.png](img.png)

## Description

Ever looked at your GitHub contributions graph and wished it was greener, fuller, and just more impressive? üå≥ Maybe you want to show off a year's worth of solid work or perhaps visualize it in 3D like this [awesome example](https://github.com/yoshi389111/github-profile-3d-contrib). But, oh no! Most of your contributions are tied up in private company projects you can't share. What to do?

Introducing `git-contribution`! üéâ This CLI tool is your new best friend for making your GitHub contributions map as green as a lush forest. Select the author you want to extract logs from, and we'll handle the rest. **No real information from your original projects is exposed**; we only take the author's name and the commit dates to recreate these in a new repository. This means you can push these to your personal GitHub and watch your contribution graph turn green! üåü

**Important Reminder**: Your GitHub name and email must match the ones used in these new commits for them to show up on your contribution map! Otherwise, no green squares for you. üü•

**Remember**: More green squares don't make you a better programmer. This is just for fun and to showcase your hard work. Keep contributing and coding with passion! ‚ù§Ô∏èüë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª
